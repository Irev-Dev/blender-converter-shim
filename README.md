A small project for making big smoothies with a 2 litre jar ðŸ¥¤

Please note that 3d printing and food safety can be tricky even with food safe plastics, due to the additive process. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that with this design the glass jar is what contacts the seal, not the plastic, but it's still at your own risk.

If you want to work with the scad file there are two options:

1) If you're familiar with git the easiest way to get started is to clone with submodules

    ``` git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Irev-Dev/blender-converter-shim.git ```

2) Otherwise you can download each of the three libraries I used for this project and put them in your local openscad library director, once you've done that you need to comment out the first set of `use` statements and uncomment the second set of use statements. As the second set is for using the library folder.
[Instructions on how to include libraries](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries).
Libraries that need to be installed:
    - [Round-Anything](https://github.com/Irev-Dev/Round-Anything)
    - [scad-utils](https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils)
    - [list-comprehension-demos](https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos)
